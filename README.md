# hello-world

Hi

I'm just here taking a deeper look in development and will start to make some code here!
I've worked with support, change management, and now with infrastructure, more specifically with the Microsoft Exchange environment like AD, WAP, Office Online and the Exchange Servers. Automation is what I like most. I've done lots of PowerShell scripts, from exporting users data to migration scripts.
